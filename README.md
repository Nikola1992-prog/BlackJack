* Game goal

    The aim of blackjack is to finish the game with a higher total than that of the dealer, without exceeding 21. Going over 21 is commonly known as ‘busting’ and means an automatic     loss.

* Game rules
  - Each player starts with two cards, one of the dealer's cards is hidden until the end.
  - To 'Hit' is to ask for another card. To 'Stand' is to hold your total and end your turn.
  - If you go over 21 you bust, and the dealer wins regardless of the dealer's hand.
  - If you are dealt 21 from the start (Ace & 10), you got a blackjack.
  - Blackjack usually means you win 1.5 the amount of your bet.
  - Dealer will hit until his/her are equal to cards total sum od player cards or higher.
  - If you win amount of your hand bet is added to your account, else you lose same amount of bet from your account
